# Inferno Game Engine
Welcome to the Inferno Game Engine Documentation.

## Quick Start Notes:
Follow these to start using Inferno (These will be refined once Inferno evolves)

1. Create a new project (Template coming soon, for now use windows forms)
2. Delete windows forms references and files (Leaving just Program.cs)
3. Create a new class inheriting Inferno.Game
4. In Program.cs Add "using(var game = new GameClassName()) game.Run();"
5. Develop your game
