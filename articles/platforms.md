# Possible Target Platforms
Inferno utilises Monogame to allow for it to cater for a number of Target Platforms.

## Targets

### Windows (DirectX)
In an early, non public build Windows x86 DirectX support was removed due to Desktop support being sufficient.

### Desktop (OpenGL) (Windows/Mac/Linux)
The Desktop platform is the most supported. Through Mono it can run on Mac and Linux PCs as well as Windows natively. This is why it is far superior to Windows DirectX

### UWP (DirectX)
All UWP platforms are supported through Inferno, all current implementations *WORK* on UWP, but some features may not work as expected on XBOX ONE

### Android
Android support has not yet been created.

### iOS
iOS support has not yet been created.

### PS(X)/Switch
There is no support for other consoles other than XBOX ONE through UWP.

## How to get a target supported
If you wish to see Inferno target a new platform, you may either wait for support to be added by another, or create a fork, develop it, then have it added to a list of official 3rd party ports.
